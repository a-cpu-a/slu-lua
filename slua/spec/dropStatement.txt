Drop Statement {
	
	Drop a local variable or expression explicitly
	
	This is useful, for deleting variables before they have gone out of scope.
	
	When passed a deref type (*&xxx), the lifetime of that variable is dropped.
	static, and thread local lifetimes are not allowed.
	
	The following drops both y and z, cuz the if doesnt decay the (de)references to both variables.
	```
	drop (if x => y else => z);
	```
	Not one of the following:
	B: does nothing if y and z are trivialy copyable, otherwise just like A.
	C: error if they are trivialy copyable.
	D: always drop both, even if one/both are trivialy copyable.
