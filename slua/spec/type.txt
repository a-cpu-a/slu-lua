Official Types {

	(names starting with a capital are complex types)

	void {
		Nothing, no type is allowed.
		Variables and function arguments cant have this type.
		Only allowed as function return type.
	}
	bool {
		A lua boolean
	}
	integer {
		A 25, 32, 64, or 54 bit integer
		54 bit integers are only for luajit, and older versions of lua (can store up to 2^53).
		25 bit integers are for 32bit versions of lua pre 5.3 (can store up to 2^24
		
		Slua types can be cast into this, any overflows are still handled.
		
		Platform specific, so on some very old platforms, might be 8 or 16 bit sized.
	}
	number {
		A 32 or 64 bit float, might also be a integer on some lua versions.
		
		Slua types can be cast into this, any overflows are still handled.
	}
	ptrdata {
		Basic data / pointer passed from compiler (light-data)
	}
	
	Any {
		Any type is allowed, except void
	}
	str {
		A lua-like string, immutable.
		Unlike lua, this is just a reference to a real string, or part of one.
		
		a sized array of utf8 bytes, or utf16 chars.
		
		Must be valid utf8, using the old standard that allows charaters up to 32~ bits, and without any surrogate pairs.
		Or valid utf16, with no malformed surrogate pairs.
		
		On most platforms the contents are utf8.
		
		Some platforms, like java & javascript use utf16.
	}
	String {
		A mutable string.
		
		Same restrictions on content as "str".
		
		Creating invalid content isnt ub in itself, but some libraries or functions will not handle that correctly.
	}
	Table {
		A lua like table, can have fields and indices
		Valid keys: any lua type, except nil or NaN. Yes, this also includes floats and negative numbers.
	}
	Func {
		Any function: C, lua, etc
	}
	Userdata {
		Special data passed from the compiler
	}
	Thread {
		The coroutines
	}
	f8,f16,f128 {
		Reserved, may be used in the future.
		(intended for uses outside of lua, but will be supported inside lua, when added)
	}
	f32,f64 {
		32 or 64 bit floats.
		
		Implementation {
			When compiling to lua, f32 may be interpreted as f64, for performance reasons.
			Do not rely on that!
			
			if only f32 is natively available, then f64 is emulated.
		}
	}
	i8,i16,i32,i64,i128 {
		Optimized 8,16,32,64 or 128 bit signed integers.
		Implementation {
			i32, i64 may be emulated on platforms like luajit, or 32bit versions of lua.
			i128 is always emulated in lua.
		}
	}
	u8,u16,u32,u64,u128 {
		Optimized 8,16,32,64 or 128 bit unsigned integers.
		Implementation {
			u32, u64 may be emulated on platforms like luajit, or 32bit versions of lua.
			u64 multiplication, division, modulo, exp are all emulated on normal lua, but are optimized on slua runtimes (luajit might be optimized when possible too).
			u128 is always emulated in lua.
		}
	}
	isize {
		i32, i54, i64, ... depending on platform.
	}
	usize {
		u32, u54, u64, ... depending on platform.
	}
}

Type Specifiers {
	
	Array {
		Format: "[" X arraySizer "]"  --TODO: should this exist: {arraySizer}
		Sizes must be positive integers, or be zero
		
		Multiple array sizers can be used, to create multi-dimensional arrays
		
		Unlike table arrays, negative or zero indices will error.
		Out of bounds access will also error.
		
		Indices start at 1
		
		Implementation {
			Accessing elements through normal lua code is not supported, unless exported to lua.
			
			multi-dimensional arrays may be flattened into less dimensions.
			
			The compiler must prove that indices will always be valid, before removing run-time checks.
		}
	}
	Slice {
		Format: "[" X "]"
		
		Unlike table arrays, negative or zero indices will error.
		Out of bounds access will also error.
		
		Implementation {
			Accessing elements through normal lua code is not supported, unless exported to lua.
			
			multi-dimensional arrays must not be flattened into 1 dimension, unless sizes can be predicted at compile time.
			
			The compiler must prove that indices will always be valid, before removing run-time checks.
		}
	}
	Result {
		Format: [X] "?" X
		Format: [X] "??"
		
		Allows both a error, and a value, or just an error, and the value type is inferred.
		The type specifier '??' is just like '?', except the error type is inferred.
		
		Allows use of the "?" operator, and other error handling tools.
	}
	GC {
		Format: "#" ["mut"] X
		
		Turns the type into a gc-value, this means that it can be passed into other
		functions, and they can then modify that variable.
		It is also garbage collected, unless lifetime is simple enough to be inlined into some value type + borrows
		
		Passing this to other threads is not allowed if it is mutable, this means you cant store mutable gc-values in global variables.
		
		Borrowing these is allowed.
		
		Use the "alloc" unary operator, to create these.
	}
	Borrow {
		Format "&" {borrowLifetime} ["mut"] X
		
		Makes the type borrowing, this means that it is a borrowed value.
		
		```slua
		let firstArg = --...
		let secondArg = --...
		
		let &/firstArg u8 myRef = &firstArg;
		
		let &mut u8 myRef2 = &mut secondArg;-- The annotation is inferred here.
		
		drop myRef2;-- Required, because not adding this, will produce a soft-error.
		
		let &/firstArg/secondArg u8 z = &firstArg;-- This requires dropping "myRef2", as you cant have 2 variables potentially holding a reference to the same variable.
		
		```
	}
	Deref {
		Format "*" X
		
		Represents a dereferenced borrow / ptr.
		
		```slua
		
		let x = 4;
		
		let *&mut u8 xAlias = x;
		xAlias = 3;
		
		assertEq$(x,3);
		
		let **mut u8 xAliasUnsafe = x;
		
		unsafe {
			xAliasUnsafe = 2;
		}
		assertEq$(x,2);
		
		
		let y = &x;
		
		let *&/x u8 z = *y; --The type represents, a derefed reference for some u8 with lifetime "x".
		let w = *y; --The type is just u8, as a copy was possible.
		
		
		```
	}
	Pointer {
		Format "*" ("mut" | "const") X
		
		Makes the type a pointer.
		
		```slua
		let firstArg = --...
		let secondArg = --...
		
		
		--Its (mostly) safe to make pointers, but not to use them.
		--Some hosts dont support pointers. (Most do, like js,java,lua,cpp, ...)
		
		let *const u8 myPtr = *const firstArg;
		
		let *mut u8 myPtr2 = *mut secondArg;
		
		drop myPtr2;--Drops the pointer, not really meaningfull
		
		let *const u8 z = *const firstArg;
		
	:::unsafe:
		
		z = 4;
		
		```
	}
