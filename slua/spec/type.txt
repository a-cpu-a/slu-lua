Official Types {

	(names starting with a capital are complex types)

	void {
		Nothing, no type is allowed.
		Variables and function arguments cant have this type.
		Only allowed as function return type.
	}
	bool {
		A lua boolean
	}
	integer {
		A 25, 32, 64, or 54 bit integer
		54 bit integers are only for luajit (can store up to 2^53).
		25 bit integers are for 32bit versions of lua pre 5.3 (can store up to 2^24
		
		--[[
			Should slua types be allowed here? u128, i128 too?
		]]
	}
	number {
		A 32 or 64 bit float, might also be a integer on some lua versions.
		
		--[[
			Should slua types be allowed here? u128, i128 too?
		]]
	}
	ptrdata {
		Lightdata passed from C
	}
	
	Any {
		Any type is allowed (even void)
	}
	str {
		A lua-like string, immutable.
		Unlike lua, this is just a reference to a real string, or part of one.
		
		a sized array of utf8 bytes, or utf16 chars.
		
		Must be valid utf8, using the old standard that allows charaters up to 32~ bits, and without any surrogate pairs.
		Or valid utf16, with no malformed surrogate pairs.
		
		On most platforms the contents are utf8.
		
		Some platforms, like java & javascript use utf16.
	}
	String {
		A mutable string.
		
		Same restrictions on content as "str".
	}
	Table {
		A lua table, can have fields and indices
	}
	Func {
		Any function C, lua, etc
	}
	Userdata {
		Things passed from C
	}
	Thread {
		The coroutines
	}
	f8,f16,f128 {
		Reserved, may be used in the future.
		(intended for uses outside of lua, but will be supported inside lua, when added)
	}
	f32,f64 {
		32 or 64 bit floats.
		
		Implementation {
			When compiling to lua, f32 may be interpreted as f64, for performance reasons.
			Do not rely on that!
			
			if only f32 is natively available, then f64 is emulated.
		}
	}
	i8,i16,i32,i64,i128 {
		Optimized 8,16,32,64 or 128 bit signed integers.
		Implementation {
			i64 may be emulated on platforms like luajit, or 32bit versions of lua.
			i128 is always emulated in lua.
		}
	}
	u8,u16,u32,u64,u128 {
		Optimized 8,16,32,64 or 128 bit unsigned integers.
		Implementation {
			u64 may be emulated on platforms like luajit, or 32bit versions of lua.
			u64 multiplication, division, modulo, exp are all emulated on normal lua, but are optimized on slua runtimes (luajit might be optimized when possible too).
			u128 is always emulated in lua.
		}
	}
	isize {
		i32, i54, i64, ... depending on platform.
	}
	usize {
		u32, u54, u64, ... depending on platform.
	}
}

Type Specifiers {
	
	Table Array {
		Format: "[" X arraySizer {arraySizer} "]"
		Sizes must be positive integers, or be zero
		
		Multiple array sizers can be used, to create multi-dimensional arrays
		
		Unlike table arrays, negative or zero indices will error.
		Out of bounds access will also error.
		
		Indices start at 1
		
		Implementation {
			Accessing elements through normal lua code is not supported.
			
			multi-dimensional arrays may be flattened into 1 dimension.
			
			The compiler must prove that indices will always be valid, to remove run-time checks.
		}
	}
	Dynamic Array {
		Format: "[" X "]"
		Sizes: same as table
		
		Unlike table arrays, negative or zero indices will error.
		Out of bounds access will also error.
		
		Implementation {
			Accessing elements through normal lua code is not supported.
			
			multi-dimensional arrays must not be flattened into 1 dimension, unless sizes can be predicted at compile time.
			
			The compiler must prove that indices will always be valid, to remove run-time checks.
		}
	}
	Result {
		Format: [X] "?" X
		
		Allows both a error, and a value, or just a error.
		
		Allows use of the "?" operator, and other error handling tools.
	}
	GC {
		Format: "#" X
		
		Turns the type into a gc-value, this means that it can be passed into other
		functions, and they can then modify that variable.
		It is also garbage collected, unless lifetime is simple enough to be inlined into some value type + borrows
		
		Passing this to other threads is not allowed, this means you cant store gc-values in global variables.
		
		Mutably-borrowing these is also not allowed.
	}
	Borrow {
		Format "&" ["mut"] X {borrowAnnotation}
		
		Makes the type borrowing, this means that it is a borrowed value.
		
		```slua
		let firstArg = --...
		let secondArg = --...
		
		let &u8/firstArg myRef = &firstArg;
		
		let &mut u8 myRef2 = &mut secondArg;-- The annotation is inferred here.
		
		--drop myRef2;-- Automatically added here.
		
		let &u8/firstArg/secondArg = &firstArg;-- This automatically drops "myRef2", as it would conflict with this variable.
		
		```
