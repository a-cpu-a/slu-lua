Array Constructor {
	
	Construct an array of one item X many times
	
	`y**x` -> x the element, y how many of it.
	x must be copyable (any kind).
	y must be a non-negative integer.
	if y is 0, then x will not be evaluated.
	
	The result of the operator is not a real value, and can only be used inside of a table constructor.
