Logging {
	
	Error -> No executable is output, compilation will halt early.
	
	Soft-error {
		A error that needs to be fixed, but a executable is output.
		
		Just like a warning, the compiler has to assume some intentions.
		(missing '?' -> insert it for you)
	}
	
	Warning -> Something that might need to be fixed, or annotated.
