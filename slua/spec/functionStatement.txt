New Syntax {
	
	stat @::= | OptExportPrefix [safety] PreFn "function" Name "(" [paramList] ")" ["->" typeExp] statOrRet
}

Function Statement {
	
	Creates a new global or local function with a name 'Name', that cant be modified.
	
	The default return type is "DynAny"
	
	Params are mutable by default.
	The default type for params is DynAny, as there is no information to infer anything.
	
	
	Implementation {
		In lua, this can be a local function, or a global function, could also be a table with a special metatable.
		The function might be frozen at runtime (metatable, or internal stuff)
		If something somehow modifies the function variable, the changes might be ignored.
	}
