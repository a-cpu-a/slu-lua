Axioms {
	
	Axioms would let you choose the things you trust.
	
	Stable -> everything marked unstable, becomes safe. (maybe a way to choose what exactly is stable too)
	
	Ptr -> ptrs are safe.
	SingleThreaded -> assume compilation for single thread, so no need to worry about concurrent accesses.
	All -> everything is safe, no need to add unsafe blocks.
