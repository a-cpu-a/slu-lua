Errors {
	
	The type specifier '?' is just like '//', except the error type is inferred.
	
	The type specifier '//' is used to mark a function as possibly returning an error.
	Those types are the only types allowed for the "?" unary operator.
	When returning errors by value, it is a tuple containing the Error, and the Value.
	When returning errors by exception, it is optimized into just the Value (or nothing at all).
	It is an error to assign a possibly errored value to a variable, this is because allowing that would complicate unwinding a lot.
	
	The error types also have some special functions, defined by the compiler {
		get(self)->Value 						--Panics, if it is a error, otherwise returns the value.
		getOr(self,Value default)->Value		--Returns value, or the default value
		wrapError(self,ErrWrapFunc(E,Err) op)->Value?E	--Changes the error, (only if it is an error)
		
		ok(self)->Option(Value)					--Returns Some(x), if there is no error, else nil.
		err(self)->Option(Err)					--Returns Some(x), if there is a error, else nil.
	}
	
	Postfix "?" unary operator passes the error upwards.
	If an error is silently ignored, a soft-error is logged at compile-time, and the operator is inserted.
	Using the "?" operator on types that arent specified with '//' or '?', is a soft-error. (operator is ignored)
	
	To explicitly ignore a error use drop.
	(drop myErroringFunc();)
	
	The throw statment is used to return a error.
	It is converted to stack unwinding or a return, depending on what the "try" chooses.
	
	--TODO: choose a way for devs to configure between "stack unwinding" and "return value"
	-- AND make the differences clear.
	-- Option: allow specifying the chance of error (1% -> stack unwind, 10% -> return value)
	-- Option: allow specifying the code-size preferance (smaller -> stack unwind (only in big projects), bigger -> return value)
	-- Option: ignore the fact devs are wrongly biased on this issue, and add some keywords. (errval | unwind)
	Try expressions allow you to handle errors from a function call.
	Any unmatched errors are automatically propagated outside, letting you use a "?" operator again.
	
	Try expressions are a wrapper for using match twice.
	Once to unwrap into value & error, returning instantly unless it is an error.
	Second to figure out what kind of error it is, and then handle it.
	
	First matching pattern will be used. (top to bottom)
	The order inside the patterns is undefined.
	
	Unmatched errors are passed down as if they werent ever caught, and are added to the return type, if it isnt already specified,
	this means that you have to use the '?' operator, or catch it elsewhere.
	
	```slua
	
	fn myErrFunc() -> u8//Err {
		-- ...
		throw Err::OOM{};-- Error!
		-- ...
	}

	let u8 passTheError = myErrFunc()?;				-- Get the value or propagate the error
	let u8 panicOnError = myErrFunc():get();		-- Get the value or panic
	let u8 neverError = myErrFunc():getOr(100);	-- Get the value or return ...
	
	let u8 differentError = myErrFunc()
		:wrapError(fn(e){ return "Oh no: "..e }); -- Changes the error type, and prefixes the error message.
	
	let u8 qq = try(myErrFunc()){
	
		-- The return type is optional. 
		-- -> u8?(some variant), the ? and the stuff after it, would be needed since we arent matching every error.
		
		Err::PMsg x => panic$("Error " .. x.1);-- PMsg is a tuple, we are indexing into the first element
		
		Err::OOM => panic$("Out of memory!");
		Err::Msg{v} => gen {
			print(v);
			
			return 0;
		}
		
		-- If this is was added, "?" suffix wouldnt be needed, cuz Err::Unknown would be caught.
		--else => panic$("Unknown error"); 
		
	}?;-- Try is suffixed with a ?, since "Err::Unknown" isnt handled.
	```
	
	Implementation {
		
		Errors can be handled via exceptions (stack unwinding) or returned as values.
		
		The compiler can choose which will be faster in some cases, but is recommended to trust the developer.
		A compiler flag to choose the default should exist, and most of the time it should default to "unwind"
		
		Return by value could be implemented using a register flag.
		
		error types will either be turned into some tuple, just the value, or void.
		Functions returning errors could be compiled twice, to allow users to use both exceptions and error values.
		It is recommended for compilers to defer the duplication to as late as possible.
		(Static linking -> no split)
		(Dynamic linking -> no choice, but to split)
