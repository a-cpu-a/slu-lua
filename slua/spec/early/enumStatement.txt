Enum Statement {
	
	Defines a new enum type.
	
	Enums can only contain one of the fields that are inside the field-list.
	
	Using enums is safe, as they store the active option they use.
	
	The layout is defined by annotations.
	The default layout is optimized for size & speed, and can change depending on where it is used.
	Ofcourse it can be fixed to a standard format, by using (TODO: ???), however this will prevent some optimizations.
	
	Implementation {
		Must support atleast 32768 fields.
	}
