Whitespace {
	
	Whitespace is fully ignored in a way that code cant rely on it or read it.
	Whitespace is ignored while parsing.
	
	Whitespace characters include the standard ASCII whitespace characters space, form feed, newline, carriage return, horizontal tab, and vertical tab.
	
	Whitespace includes comments, both multi-line and single-line.
	
	Single line comments start with '--' and end at a newline.
	Single line comments dont start with 3 dashes, since 3 dashes identify a doc-comment.
	Single line comments dont start with '--^', since that identifies a doc-comment.
	
	
	Multiline comments:

	We define an opening long bracket of level n as
	an opening square bracket followed by n equal
	signs followed by another opening square bracket.

	So, an opening long bracket of level 1 is written
	as [=[, an opening long bracket of level 2 is
	written as [==[, and so on.
	
	The minimum long bracket level is 1.

	A closing long bracket is defined similarly; for
	instance, a closing long bracket of level 4 is
	written as ]====].

	A long literal starts with
	an opening long bracket of any level and ends at
	the first closing long bracket of the same level.

	It can contain any text except a closing bracket
	of the same level.

	Literals in this bracketed form can run for
	several lines, do not interpret any escape
	sequences, and ignore long brackets of
	any other level.


	In the spec, whenever there is a space inside one of the ebnf's, whitespace may be inserted.
