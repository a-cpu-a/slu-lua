Comptime Keyword {
	
	This can mark something, or make a expression run at compile-time.
	
	It can be used on a expression to make it run a compile-time,
	this means you can speed up things like string concatentation,
	it will error, if the expression uses something from the runtime.
	
	It can mark a function, or variable as compile-time evaluated.
	
	This means that the variable must have its value computed at compile-time.
	Or that the function must be executed at compile-time.
	
	
	Implementation {
		Likely just compile the needed functions, variables, constants, types into some lua_state, to run the stuff.
		And then cache the results, until something changes.
		
		note: (Normal functions can be evaluated at compile-time, or run-time)
	}
