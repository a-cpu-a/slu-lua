New Syntax {

	annotations ::= {annotation}
	
	annotation ::= "@" rawVar args
	
	--TODO: finish injecting into existing syntax (pre stat, pre type defs, pre exp, pre ...)
}

Annotation {
	
	Allows adding info to stuff, for reflection, or compilation.
	
	There are some annotations that can change how code is compiled,
	or how code is exported, etc.
	
	Some annotations error, when put on the wrong things.
	
	@Builtin(info=string) - allows for referencing some builtin value, type, etc.
	The string is a namespaced path to something. 
	For example 
	```
	ex type Expr = @Builtin("base::type/exp")void;
	```
	
	A error is produced, if the builtin doesnt exist.
