Fn Statement {
	
	Creates a new global or local function with a name 'Name', that cant be modified.
	
	Param types, and return type are assigned automatically, if missing.
	
	Params are const by default.
	The default type for params is Any, as there is no information to infer anything.
	
	Partially equivalent to "local function x() end", except, it can be exported.
	
	
	Implementation {
		In lua, this can be a local function, or a global function.
		The function might be frozen at runtime (metatable, or internal stuff)
		If something somehow modifies the function variable, the changes might be ignored.
