Const Statment {
	
	Creates a new global variable with a name 'Name', that cant be modified (not even its contents)
	
	
	Partialy equivelant to "local <const> x = 1234",
	except, it can be imported (and if x is a table / whatever, its contents cant be edited)
	
	
	Implementation {
		May be a local <const> variable
		Or a global variable
		
		The value might be frozen at runtime (metatable, or internal stuff)
		
		If something somehow modifies a const variable, the changes might be ignored
	}
