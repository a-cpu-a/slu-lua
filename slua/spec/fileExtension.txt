File Extension {
	
	it will be ".slu"
	
	".slua" was once used for something called sharp lua, but that isnt rly developed anymore (13~ years ago).
	Its some unity extension thing, no idea why it produces .slua files tho, since they are just .lua files
	And on github there are kinda too many files (700)

	".slu" seems to be used for some shell files, which is not a big deal, esp cuz there are only ~50 of them on github.
	And because, slua could support its own shell header thing, making sure its the right one.

	".sl" seems to be used alot for other language files (shell, slash)
